- Check backend URL is accessible
- Check network connection
- Check browser console for CORS errors

### Data not updating
- Refresh the page
- Check console for API errors
- Verify backend is running

### Airtable Fetch/Sync Issues
- **"Error fetching from Airtable"**
  - Check backend logs for Airtable API errors
  - Verify Airtable token is configured in backend environment
  - Confirm Base ID and Table ID are correct
  - Try the "Fetch from Airtable" button on Speakers page to test connection
  
- **"No speakers found in Airtable"**
  - Verify the Airtable table has records
